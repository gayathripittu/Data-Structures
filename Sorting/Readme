Project 1: Experimental Analysis on Sorting Algorithms
Overview
This project involves the implementation and detailed performance analysis of various sorting algorithms. Our goal is to understand the efficiency of each algorithm in different scenarios.

Implemented Algorithms
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Heapsort
Quick Sort
3-way Merge Sort 
Analysis Focus
We analyze the algorithms based on:

Running time
Number of comparisons
Performance under different data conditions
Data and Output
Input: Diverse datasets of varying sizes.
Output: Detailed statistics including size of input, number of comparisons, and execution time.

The key findings are:

Insertion Sort: Highly efficient for small or already sorted data sets, but less effective for larger, unsorted data.
Merge Sort & 3-way Merge Sort: Both perform well on larger data sets, with 3-way Merge Sort being theoretically more efficient but slower in practice due to increased comparisons.
Heap Sort: Ideal for large data sets and limited space, offering a balance between speed and space efficiency.
